										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Randy M. Crews and I am a Kennesaw State University (KSU) graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I currently work at a restaurant at the Mall of Georgia and I am pursuing a full-time position in my field of study.</p>
									<p>For a little background: My interest in the field of computer science started when I was very young. I was exposed to video games early in my childhood and this pushed me to become very familiar with computers and systems at a very young age. Ever since, I have had a knack for navigating and utilizing many parts of the internet and different kinds of software. I was first exposed to coding in early high school through a web design class that introduced me to HTML. I excelled in that class and subject and was curious to see how far I could push my talents in other kinds of coding. I took an Introduction to Java class and learned the language quite easily. The solutions came to me naturally and by that point I decided to pursue Computer Science seriously.</p>
									<p>Since enrolling at KSU, I have attended a wide variety of classes showcasing certain coding concepts and different coding languages. Programming Principles took me through general Java usage and object oriented programming. Data Structures gave me a look into C++ as a language as well as showing me different ways to manage, store and manipulate data. Algorithm Analysis showed me how to make code more efficient using quantifiers such as Big O notation and gave me insight into what types of code are used in specific contexts. I recently completed working on my senior project with a team, developing a crowdfunding application/website that utilizes blockchain.</p>
									<p>Personally, my general work ethic is such that, if there is a job to be done my goal is to complete it in the most efficient way possible. I like to weigh team membersâ€™ strengths and organize our work accordingly, in a way that is efficient without sacrificing quality in detail.</p>
